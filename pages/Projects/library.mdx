## Overview 
Small library app to keep track of your books on local storage.

## Skills used 
- JavaScript objects and object constructors
- JavaScript ```JSON.stringify``` and ```JSON.parse```
- HTML modal
- CSS

## Features
- add or delete book
- keeps track of the book title, author, pages, whether or not you have read the book
- toggle whether or not you have read the book after adding books

## Lessons Learned 
- using modal
- DOM manipulation for input checkbox
- Creating book card did not function as expected at first. This was caused due to using wrong ID name for DOM manipulation
- Delete and Remove buttons on each book card did not function as expected. Resolved by adding event listeners inside ```CreateBookCard```

export default ({ children }) => (
  <Layout meta={meta}>
    <ProjectLayout>{children}</ProjectLayout>
  </Layout>
);
