# Etch A Sketch

## Overview

Objective is to create a web-browser version of something between a sketchpad and an Etch-A-Sketch using Javascript DOM manipulation and CSS grid. This is my third project using Javascript.

## Skills used

- HTML
- CSS
- Vanilla Javascript

## Features
- 1 Color Mode allows to sketch on mouse over with a single default color
- Random Mode allows to sketch on mouse over with 5 colors chosen randomely
- Shake deletes the sketch and resets the grid to the selected grid size
- Small Pixel creates a grid of 32 X 32
- Medium Pixel creates a grid of 16 X 16
- Large Pixel creates a grid of 8 X 8

## Lessons Learned
1. At first, the small pixel grid would flow over the container, and the large pixel grid would leave empty spaces inside the container. This was caused due to adding a fixed size on grid-template-columns: and grid-template-rows: on CSS for the container. Once I removed those from the CSS and added

```js
container.style.gridTemplateColumns = `repeat(${size},1fr)`;
container.style.gridTemplateRows = `repeat(${size},1fr)`;
```

on Javascript, the grids functioned as I wanted.

2. Initially, the chosen method of enabling sketching on mouseover was:

```javascript
const square = document.querySelector("div");
square.addEventListener("mouseover", function (event) {
  event.target.classList.replace("grids", "color");
});
```
However, to create coherence in code for the Random Mode and 1 Color Mode, and to utilize Javascript more for the project, global variable of currentMode had been declared.

export default ({ children }) => (
  <Layout meta={meta}>
    <ProjectLayout>{children}</ProjectLayout>
  </Layout>
);
